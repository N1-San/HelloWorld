# Hello World
a simple hello world project......seriously, this is just a project that has a `Hello World`.

If you don't know yet, I start every ReadMe file of all my projects with, "a simple `<project name>`". While I was just watching a YouTuber [ForrestKnight](https://github.com/forrestknight)'s [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2B-FClr5rA&list=PLiVe36BQmGS0--r2m1gHuC7vOqWTWaeUE&index=8) video, the first project he talks about in the video is a `Hello World` project. 

So here we are, here is a project with a `Hello World` program written in every language I have ever remotely touched or read the documentation off.

## Why Hello World?
because you can't deny the fact that the first program in every language that almost everyone ever writes even if it is just to test if the compiler is working is a `Hello World` program, and I think that it does not get the recognition and the respect that it deserves.

So this is my tribute to the one who has helped us countless times.

Thank you `Hello World` We won't be where we are without you.
